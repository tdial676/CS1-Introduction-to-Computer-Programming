CS 1 Assignment Collaboration Component (Required)
Name: Thierno Diallo, tdiallo@caltech.edu
Partner: Ethan Barajas, ebarajas@calteh.edu
Collaborated on: Lab 6 part B and C
Estimated time collaborating: 2 hours

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collaboration (at least 3 sentences answering some or all of the following):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What did collaboration look like between you and your partner on the Lab 6
resubmission?
How long did you spend on the resubmission independently vs. with your partner?
Did you collaborate via Zoom? In-person?
Did you walk through each of each other's code (this is ok, as long as you aren't
copy/pasting each other's code)?
What questions did you ask your partner? How did they answer? (recommended to
provide a bulleted-list here, especially for your own takeaways/common bugs)
Did you use any visual/pseudocode strategies (white board, paper, tablet, etc.)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We collaborated in person. We worked through the pseudocode together on a
white board for the problems we were having trouble with. I had a lot of
errors so my partner would map out the pseudocode and explain why the error
might be caused. We looked at each others code for when we ran into syntax errors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reflection (at least 3 sentences):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How was your overall experience working with your partner?
Did you learn anything new (debugging strategies, Lab 6 material, etc.)
Would you recommend collaboration in this way in Lab 6 for future offerings of
CS 1?

I enjoyed having someone there to help me map out my ideas because sometimes
all I needed was to put my thoughts into words. Also, it was a lot easier
debugging code because I had a second perspective on what might be causing
my errors. I also enjoyed gaining a new perspective on how to approach
challenging problems. I would definitely recommend more group oriented projects
in the future because I feel that it replicates what it feels like in the work
force and it is a great learning opportunity as being able to work well with
others is integral in today's self-centric world.
