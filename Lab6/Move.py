Move class for the Pokemon simulator, supporting PokemonSpecies moves.
This class is provided for students for Lab 6.

Students may add methods to this class if they are appropriate
when implementing lab6.py's miniproject. If they do, they
must submit this file in their CodePost submissions.
Some optional additions could include:

- get_move_label() - returns 'DP', 'Buff', or 'Debuff'
    (get_move_type is another good name, but is confusing with
     the actual move_type string which is a Pokemon type)
- is_dp() - True if DP move, else False for Buff/Debuff
- Use subclasses for a Move called DPMove and BuffMove
    - DPMove would have a dp attribute, no buff attributes,
      and string representation for DP move (see __str__() below)
    - BuffMove would have BUFF_TYPES constant, buff_type attribute,
      buff_amt, and string representation for buffs/debuffs
      (see __str__() below)

class Move:
    # There are three buff types supported in the Pokemon simulator
    BUFF_TYPES = ['Accuracy', 'Attack', 'Defense']

    """
    Represents a Pokemon move object with the following attributes:
    `name` (str) - name of the move (e.g. 'Thunderbolt')
    `type` (str) - type of move (e.g. 'electric')
    `accuracy` (float) - accuracy rating of the move.

    Physical moves (have DP, no buffs):
    `dp` (int) - DP ("damage point") value of the move

    Special Moves (update buffs, no DP):
    `buff` (str) - buff type of move ('Accuracy', 'Attack', or 'Defense')
    `buff_amt` (int) - amount of buff
        + for positive buff,
        0 for none
        - for negative buff
    """
    def __init__(self, move_name, move_type, acc, dp, buff, buff_amt):
        """
        Constructs a Move object with a given `move_name` (str),
        `move_type` (str), `acc` accuracy rate (float between 0.0 and 1.0),
        `dp` damage point count, `buff` buff type (str), and `buff_amt` (int).
        There is some user-friendly argument handling, such as converting a
        non-empty string `dp` or 'buff_amt' like '1' to an int.

        Moves must be either "DP" damage moves without buffs, or "Buff/Debuff"
        moves. A buff move has a positive `buff_amt` to increase a Pokemon's
        stats. A debuff move has a negative `buff_amt` to decrease a Pokemon's
        stats.

        Requirements:
        - `acc` must be between [0.0, 1.0]
        - If given a positive `dp` value, the move is considered a DP move and
            buff values are ignored. In "real Pokemon" a move can have both DP
            and buff effects, so students may support this however they want
            (including ignoring buffs for a given DP).
        - Otherwise (`dp` is '', None, or 0) the move is considered a buff move
            with the following requirements:
                - `buff_type` must be a type specified in `BUFF_TYPES`
                - `buff_amt` must be a non-zero number (usually an int)

        If given invalid arguments, raises a ValueError that should
        be handled when calling the constructor.
